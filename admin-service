hi i have covered below topics today..
1. tags:
  commands will be as :  git tag v1.1 -m "first tag"
  git push origin v1.0

2. to get the log details in short form we can use as:
   git log --pretty=oneline

To create a branch :
1. git checkout -b feature1
output : switched to a new branch 'feature'

2. git branch (to know the branch deatils and which branch we are:)
ouput : * feature1
         main

3. to go back to main branch from feature branch:
   git switch main
output : Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

4. to create sub or multiple branch :
  git switch --create fearture2
output : Switched to a new branch 'feature2'

5. To delete the BRANCH :
  git branch -d feature2
output : Deleted branch feature2 (was b412b4d).

6. this barnch need to push for remote one means git hub:
  git push origin main

7. switch to main and merge the feature1 branch to main:
  git merge feature1.

8. to reflect in git hub need to push again
   git push origin main
