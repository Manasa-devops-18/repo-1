hi i have covered below topics today..
1. tags:
  commands will be as :  git tag v1.1 -m "first tag"
  git push origin v1.0

2. to get the log details in short form we can use as:
   git log --pretty=oneline

To create a branch :
1. git checkout -b feature1
output : switched to a new branch 'feature'

2. git branch (to know the branch deatils and which branch we are:)
ouput : * feature1
         main

3. to go back to main branch from feature branch:
   git switch main
output : Switched to branch 'main'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
